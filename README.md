# Towards Detecting Semantic Similarity for Data Science Research Paper Documents

## Project Overview
This project aims to advance the field of data science by developing a methodology for detecting semantic similarity among research paper documents. Utilizing the power of the Euclidean semantic similarity measure and the SciBERT pretrained model, this project offers a novel approach to understanding and categorizing data science literature. A frontend application developed with Streamlit enables users to interact with the model, providing a user-friendly interface for exploring semantic relationships between documents.

In the rapidly evolving field of data science, the ability to efficiently sift through and understand vast amounts of research literature is paramount. With thousands of papers published annually, identifying and analyzing documents with similar content can significantly enhance research efficiency, foster collaborations, and drive scientific innovation. This thesis, titled "Towards Detecting Semantic Similarity for Data Science Research Paper Documents," addresses the critical need for advanced tools capable of discerning semantic relationships within the extensive body of data science literature.

Semantic similarity detection goes beyond mere keyword matching to understand the deeper meaning and context embedded within texts. By leveraging cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this research introduces a novel approach to quantifying semantic similarity among data science research documents. Central to our methodology is the use of the Euclidean semantic similarity measure coupled with the SciBERT pretrained model, a variant of the BERT model specifically fine-tuned for scientific texts. This combination allows for the effective capture of semantic nuances, setting a new standard for accuracy in literature analysis.

## Key Feature

SciBERT Integration: Utilization of the SciBERT pretrained model, specifically designed for scientific text, to enhance the accuracy of semantic similarity detection. SciBERT's deep learning architecture is fine-tuned to capture the complex semantics of scientific literature, ensuring high-quality embeddings that reflect the unique language and structure of academic research.

Dynamic Embedding Generation: At the core of our methodology is the generation of dynamic embeddings for each document. By processing research papers through the SciBERT model, we obtain rich, high-dimensional vector representations of the text. These embeddings capture the semantic essence of the documents, enabling sophisticated similarity analyses that go beyond surface-level comparisons. This feature is crucial for accurately identifying semantic correlations across a diverse range of scientific documents.

Euclidean Semantic Similarity: Leveraging Euclidean distance to quantify semantic similarity between research paper documents, enabling nuanced insights into document relationships. This approach allows for the precise measurement of the conceptual distance between texts, offering a robust method for identifying documents with closely related content.
