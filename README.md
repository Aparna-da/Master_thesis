# Towards Detecting Semantic Similarity for Data Science Research Paper Documents

## Project Overview
This project aims to advance the field of data science by developing a methodology for detecting semantic similarity among research paper documents. Utilizing the power of the Euclidean semantic similarity measure and the SciBERT pretrained model, this project offers a novel approach to understanding and categorizing data science literature. A frontend application developed with Streamlit enables users to interact with the model, providing a user-friendly interface for exploring semantic relationships between documents.
